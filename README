The file sample.php contains self-contained code to show the calendar and
can be used to adapt the display to other applications apart from MediaWiki.

The file ical.php is the MediaWiki plugin and can be activated by adding the
following to LocalSettings.php:
wfLoadExtension('ical')

It can then be used on any page by using the following tag:
<ical file="path/to/file.ics" />
or
<ical url="http://example.com/url/to/file.ics" />

The date formats can be modified by specifying the variables
$wgIcalTimeFormat, $wgIcalDateFormat and $wgIcalShortDateFormat in the
LocalSettings.php as strftime()-compatible strings or as parameters
timeformat, dateformat and shortdateformat to the <ical /> tag.

The number of days to show can be modified by setting the variable
$wgIcalDaysToShow in LocalSettings.php or the tag-parameter days.
